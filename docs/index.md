# deltatensors

**Store 50 fine-tunes in the space of two.**

`deltatensors` is a lightweight tool for post-training delta compression of fine-tuned neural network models

Train however you want: full fine-tune, FSDP, whatever. `deltatensors` diffs your fine-tuned model against the base and keeps the diff while throwing away the redundant weights. `.wdelta` files are a fraction of the size and reconstruct with under 1% perplexity difference from the original (comparable to LoRA, except it's post-training).

**Tested on Qwen2.5-0.5B fine-tuned on WikiText-2:**
- Perplexity: 19.11 (original) → 19.22 (reconstructed) — 0.58% difference, not noticeable in practice
- Beats running int4 quantization on the full fine-tuned model
- 294 MB delta vs 953 MB fine-tuned model (3.2x smaller)
- ~2.8x total storage reduction across 10 fine-tunes

## Install

```bash
pip install deltatensors
pip install torch safetensors  # for loading from safetensors directories
```

Requires Python 3.9+.

## Quick start

```python
import deltatensors as dt

# save delta between a fine-tuned and base model (streaming, O(1) RAM)
dt.save_delta_from_paths("checkpoint.wdelta", "qwen-wiki/", "qwen-base/", strategy="int4")

# reconstruct without loading the full base into RAM
recon_sd = dt.load_delta_from_paths("checkpoint.wdelta", "qwen-base/")

# inspect a delta file without a base model
info = dt.inspect("checkpoint.wdelta")
# {'path': 'checkpoint.wdelta', 'size_mb': 294.2, 'strategy': 'int4', 'n_tensors': 290, ...}
```

## Compression strategies

| Strategy | Quality | Compression |
|---|---|---|
| `int4` | near-lossless (~0.5% PPL) | best |
| `sparse` | tunable via `sparsity=` | good |
| `quantized` | BitDelta-style 1-bit | aggressive |

`int4` uses outlier extraction (top k% weights stored as float16) + 4-bit quantization for the remainder — the strategy used in the benchmark above. The outlier fraction is configurable via `outlier_fraction=` (default 0.01).

**Tip:** just stick to `int4`. `sparse` and `quantized` are there if you want to tune the tradeoff yourself or need a baseline to compare against, but `int4` wins on both quality and size in every test we've run.

## HuggingFace Trainer integration

Drop `DeltaTensorsCallback` into any `Trainer` run to save each checkpoint as a `.wdelta` instead of (or alongside) the full safetensors snapshot:

```python
from deltatensors.training import DeltaTensorsCallback
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

callback = DeltaTensorsCallback(
    base_dir="path/to/base-model",   # the model you started from
    strategy="int4",
    outlier_fraction=0.05,
    delete_full_checkpoint=False,     # set True to save disk space (can't resume training)
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=TrainingArguments(output_dir="outputs", save_steps=500, ...),
    callbacks=[callback],
    ...
)
trainer.train()
```

Each checkpoint gets a `model.wdelta` alongside the usual safetensors files. GPU compression is forced off during training — your GPU is busy with optimizer states, not free for this.

**Tip:** leave `delete_full_checkpoint=False` until you're sure you won't need to resume from that checkpoint. Once the safetensors are gone, so is `load_best_model_at_end` and training resumption — you're stuck reconstructing through `deltatensors` for everything downstream.

Reconstruct any checkpoint afterwards:

```python
sd = dt.load_delta_from_paths("outputs/checkpoint-500/model.wdelta", "path/to/base-model")
```

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md#huggingface-trainer-integration) for the full walkthrough.

## Lineage chains

Track and reconstruct a full fine-tuning history with chains of `.wdelta` files. Each delta is computed against the *prior* reconstructed model, not the original base — so incremental updates stay small.

```
base ──► v1.wdelta ──► v1_model ──► v2.wdelta ──► v2_model ──► ...
```

```python
# Save a chained delta (v2 vs reconstructed v1, not vs base)
dt.save_delta_chain_from_paths(
    "v2.wdelta",
    finetuned_dir="v2_checkpoint/",
    parent_delta_path="v1.wdelta",
    base_dir="base_model/",
    strategy="int4",
)

# Inspect the chain without loading any tensors
history = dt.inspect_chain(["v1.wdelta", "v2.wdelta", "v3.wdelta"])
for entry in history:
    print(entry["step"], entry["size_mb"], "MB", entry["parent_hash"][:8])

# Reconstruct the model at the end of the chain — verifies each hash link
sd = dt.load_delta_chain(["v1.wdelta", "v2.wdelta"], base="base_model/")
```

Each `.wdelta` records a `parent_hash` (SHA-256 of the model it was computed against). `load_delta_chain` verifies every link automatically — apply deltas in the wrong order and it raises `ValueError` instead of silently handing you a corrupted model.

`save_delta_chain_from_paths` is fully streaming: peak RAM is O(one tensor pair), not O(two full models).

**Tip:** don't delete intermediate `.wdelta` files in a chain — reconstructing v5 means replaying v1 through v5 in order. If you need v5 to stand alone, save it as a flat delta against base instead.

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md#lineage-chains) for details.

## Why not LoRA?

LoRA only works during training — the delta is forced into a low-rank matrix from the start, which caps what the fine-tune can actually learn. `deltatensors` doesn't touch training at all. Diff and compress any two trained models, anytime, no constraints on rank.

You get the quality of a real full fine-tune with the storage footprint of LoRA.
